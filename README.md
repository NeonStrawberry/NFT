# NFT
Neon's Fractal Tool. Not to be confused with "Non-Fungible Token".

# About
NFT was created by myself, originally just for my own use, but I decided to release this software for everyone to use, as long as you have a linux machine. NFT can currently render three different fractals:
- Mandelbrot set
- Burning ship
- Mandelberry (previously known as Berry's fractal)

Support for custom fractals will come eventually.

This tool ony works on GNU/Linux. If you're a programmer on Windows, feel free to port it to Windows, as long as you credit me.

# About the source code
You may have noticed that the entire source for NFT is one large file. This is because I do not like all the interesting problems that come whenever I split a project into multiple files.

# To-do list and future features
The following features are probably going to be added eventually:
- Outputting PNG files. (by March 25th, 2022)
- Once the above feature is complete, I am planning on allowing the program to output multiple PNGs automatically, allowing the user to make zoom videos. (by April 10th, 2022)
- Custom fractals. (by April 10th, 2022)
- The country of Canada. (by April 1st, 2022) (I'm serious)
